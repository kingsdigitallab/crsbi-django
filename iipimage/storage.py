    When an image is saved, the original file is converted into
    JPEG2000 format.

    The conversion process operates as follows:

    * A unique filename is generated for the uploaded image.

    * The uploaded image is saved. This image is likely not in the
      desired format, and so will require conversion, but is
      nonetheless saved at the filename that will be used for the
      converted image.

    * The initial conversion to TIFF (using ImageMagick's convert
      command) saves the new file at
      <real_filename>_1.tif. ImageMagick does not depend on the file
      extension for determining the correct format of the
      to-be-converted image, so it does not matter that it is "convert
      foo.jp2 foo_1.tif" even though foo.jp2 is a PNG, for example.

    * The converted file is converted again, using Kakadu's
      kdu_compress command, with the output file being the original
      path.
